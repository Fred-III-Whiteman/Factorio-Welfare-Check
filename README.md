# Description

Have you ever woken up early feeling refreshed, ready to take on the day and decided to hop on Factorio to make that one quick change you've been thing about and then noticed its now dark out and 6am?

This mod will *attempt* to make sure you're taking care of yourself and keeping track of time. The premise is simple, every x amount of time a prompt will appear and pause the game for y amount of time, oh yeah, you cant close the prompt until y = 0. Initially, I thought it would be best to make it so you couldn't configure the times but then I figured it would be better to allow that then have people not use the mod.

# Change log

 Version 0.0 - I havn't made the mod yet...
 
 # Planed features
 
 ## Basic features
 
 Once these features are implemented to a satisfactory state then the mod will be ready for initial release.

[ ] A dialogue prompt should open every x amount of time. Lets make x = 1 hour as default.

[ ] The dialouge prompt should say someting interesting and relevent:
    - wow would you look at the time its been like, an hour.
    - Have you drank any water tody?
    - Call your mom, she cares.
    - The fatory can wait, the bathroom can't.
    - The fatory wont expand if your dead, go get something to eat.
    - etc...
 
[ ] The dialogue prompt should pause the game and should not be able to be closed for a set amount of time, y. Let's make y = 5 minutes as default.
 
 ## Future features
 
[ ] A config menu
 
[ ] Multiplayer compatibility. I can see there being some technical issues to get this to work with multiplayer. Pausing the game, Who should the timers base off of, can anyone close the prompt. etc.
 
[ ] Extra promts based off of local time, session time, custom prompts, etc..
